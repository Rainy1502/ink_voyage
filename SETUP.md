## Dependencies Installed

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  provider: ^6.1.2              # State management
  image_picker: ^1.0.7          # Image selection
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.3    # Local storage
  http: ^1.2.1                  # HTTP requests

## Color Palette

### Light Mode
- Primary: #9810FA (Purple)
- Secondary: #8200DB (Dark Purple)
- Tertiary: #00D9FF (Cyan)
- Background: #F9FAFB (Light Gray)
- Surface: #FFFFFF (White)

### Dark Mode
- Primary: #9810FA (Purple)
- Background: #0A0A0A (Almost Black)
- Surface: #1C1C1E (Dark Gray)

## Known Notes

1. **Assets Warning**: The pubspec.yaml shows a warning about assets/images/ directory. This is normal - the directory exists and will work when you add images.

2. **Local Storage**: The app uses local storage only. Data is stored on the device and won't sync across devices.

3. **Image Handling**: 
   - URL images: Must be valid HTTP/HTTPS URLs
   - Uploaded images: Stored as file paths on device

4. **Authentication**: Basic local authentication. In production, you'd want proper backend authentication.

## Customization Tips

### Change Colors
Edit `lib/themes/light_theme.dart` and `lib/themes/dark_theme.dart`

### Add New Screens
1. Create screen in `lib/screens/`
2. Add route in `lib/main.dart` onGenerateRoute
3. Navigate using `Navigator.pushNamed()`

### Modify Book Model
1. Update `lib/models/book_model.dart`
2. Update `toMap()` and `fromMap()` methods
3. Adjust provider methods if needed

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Hot reload not working
**Solution**: Hot restart with `R` in terminal or restart button in IDE

### Issue: Assets not loading
**Solution**: Run `flutter clean` then `flutter pub get`

### Issue: Provider errors
**Solution**: Ensure you're wrapping with `Consumer` or using `Provider.of`

### Issue: Image picker not working
**Solution**: Check permissions in AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist

## Next Steps

1. **Test All Features**: Go through each screen and feature
2. **Add Sample Books**: Add a few books to test the UI
3. **Try Dark Mode**: Toggle theme to see the dark mode design
4. **Check Statistics**: Add and complete books to see charts
5. **Customize**: Adjust colors, fonts, or layouts to your preference
